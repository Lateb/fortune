Lateb fortune
=============

Compilation
-----------

First you need a fortune compiler, like strfile:

  * FreeBSD: Shipped by default;
  * OpenBSD, NetBSD: Source code here: `/usr/src/games/fortune/strfile/`;
  * Solaris: OpenCSW package `fortune`;
  * Debian, Ubuntu: Package `fortune-mod`;
  * Windows: Ah ah!;
  * Others: http://github.com/Aversiste/strfile;

When you finally found and installed/compiled it, you can run this command:

    $ strfile dat/lateb
    "lateb.dat" created
    There were 8 strings
    Longest string: 309 bytes
    Shortest string: 37 bytes

Installation
------------

You can now install these two files in your fortune directory, probably
`/usr/share/games/fortune`.
